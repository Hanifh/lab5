Tutorial for RRT

Environment Setup:
This tutorial needs pygame and other python lib; most of them should have included in the ~/anaconda2

$ export PATH="/home/robotvision/anaconda2/bin:$PATH"

(optional) Installation:
```
sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```

Task 1:
$ python rrt-pygame.py

Task 2:
$ python rrt-map.py
click a starting and end points on the map

Notice that anaconda2 may cause problem for catkin_make
In this case, open a terminal without source anaconda,
remove the devel and build folders in catkin_ws, and then
catkin_make agan
check if you have sourced ananconda
$ vim ~/.bashrc
